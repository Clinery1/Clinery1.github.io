<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I was in batch 2 of the preorders, and received my laptop August 27th, 2021.
When I got the laptop, it was no doubt the coolest thing I have ever gotten.
I have even gone as far as replacing my desktop with it (i7-6700, 16GB DDR3L, 256GB SSD+2TB HDD).</p>

<h2>About the my laptop</h2>
<p>It is configured with an i7-1165, 1x16GB DDR4 3200, 1TB NVME SSD, 2xUSB A cards, 1xUSB C card, and 1xHDMI card.
I also added a 16GB stick of DDR4 2933 from my old laptop for a total of 32GB of RAM, installed Arch Linux on the device immediately, and later Windows 10 for some games.
After using the laptop for a while, I realized that I was moving the type-C card from left to right almost every day, so I got another type-C card.
Although I can only use one for charging at a time, the laptop contains a thunderbolt controller for each side (according to <code>lshw</code>).</p>
<h2>EGPU</h2>
<p>I got an eGPU to go with this, since I heard it had thunderbolt controllers in it, but it didn't arrive till a week after I got the laptop.
Getting the eGPU to work with Linux is not an easy task, but it was doable.
I just have to reboot each time I want to plug it in (hotplug does not exist).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I have only had 3 other laptops, all of which are different brands (Toshiba, Asus, Lenovo), but none of them are as good as this laptop.
Even though this laptop is smaller than my previous (15&quot;) laptop, it is much much more powerful and capable. Even factoring in the lack of a 2-in-1.
During normal daily use, I don't ever need to move the ports around. 2xUSB A and 2x USB C are enough for me.
The only issue I have had so far was getting the fingerprint sensor to work, but that is just because I did not know how PAM and stuff worked.
Although the fingerprint sensor does still work in Linux, it for some reason no longer works with <code>xlock</code> after an update in late December.
<del>I will update this post when I get that fixed.</del>
I have fixed the issue.
It was simply that the file <code>/etc/pam.d/xlock</code> got reset to the default.
I had to add the line <code>auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so</code> to the config file.</p>
